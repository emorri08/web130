            <p id="one" class="text">I have been studying Web Design &amp; Development here for two years. This is my 9th quarter but I spent the first two doing pre-reqs so I still have a little bit left to do here. I recently applied to the App Development BAS program at North Seattle College, and I am hoping to start that in the fall while I finish the requirements for my Web Design AAS-T at Seattle Central.</p>
            <p id="two" class="text">I live in Seattle with my husband and our three very spoiled tabbies. I love animals (especially cats) and was that kid who brought home all the neighborhood stray and injured animals. I am a fairly vocal advocate for the need for more and better TNR programs as well as low cost spay/neuter programs, and the push to ban declawing.</p>
            <p id="three" class="text">In what little spare time I have, I like to read &amp; spend time with the cats. I still have a close relationship with both of my parents and I try to spend time with them as often as our schedules allow. I do try to talk to them both a few times a week when we aren't able to visit in person. I also enjoy photography, but I have not been able to get out to take photos as much as I would like to in the past few months.</p>
            <p id="four" class="text">I also enjoy watching movies (<span class="italics">Office Space</span> and <span class="italics">Spinal Tap </span>are a couple personal favorites), sketching, embroidery, crochet (even though I am not very good at it), and making candles.</p>
